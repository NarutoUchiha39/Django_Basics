Q1) What is HTTP $

Ans) HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is a type of connection such that once the user and the server agree to handshake(establish connection), Data is transfered  between the server and the client and the connection is closed automatically. It is not desirable as every time any changes are made in the server side, the entire page has to be reloaded to show the changes. This makes the loading of websites slow and costly. Whenever we send the HTTP request we send over a header file to the server that gives us back a HTML (or anything) in response to be displayed.

Types of Commands:
1) Get/Put/Delete
